This repo is to build [MeiliSeach](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases).

This repo is mainly for cross building ARMv8 and MUSL using Rust cross building tools **for my own use**.
Please use the official binary from MeiliSearch.

Idea is from StackOverflow:

The part for using cosign inside the GitHub actions is referenced from [Kyverno](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno)
