This repo is to build [MeiliSeach](https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch/releases).
The official MeiliSearch repositery itself is released by MIT license.

This repo is mainly for cross building ARMv8 and MUSL using Rust cross building tools **for my own use**.
Please use the official binary from MeiliSearch.
